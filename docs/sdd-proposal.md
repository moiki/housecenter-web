# SDD Proposal — HouseCenter Web (Frontend v2)

> **Note:** This documents the original **Untitled UI** build. The UI layer (component
> kit, Tailwind styling, dark-mode application, icons) is superseded by
> [`mui-migration-plan.md`](./mui-migration-plan.md). The API surface, routing,
> data-fetching, and form logic below remain accurate.

## Change name
`housecenter-web`

## Status
`proposed`

---

## Problem

The legacy `house-mui-v1` frontend is a React 18 CRA app that:

- Talks to a **GraphQL** backend (TypeScript/Express) that no longer exists
- Uses **Apollo Client** — entirely wrong layer for a REST API
- Has no TypeScript — no type safety, no IntelliSense for API contracts
- Uses **MUI v5 + Semantic UI + Froala** simultaneously — 3 competing design systems
- State management is `useReducer` + raw Context — no persistence, no cache, no optimistic UI
- No route protection per role — `allowedRoles` array exists but is never enforced
- No pagination — all lists load everything at once
- Missing entire modules: WorkRoutes (no page), Collaborators (no page), Invitations (no page),
  Sessions, Consultations, Reports, Notifications — none exist

The new HouseCenter .NET REST API is complete and production-ready. It needs a frontend
that actually matches its surface area and data model.

---

## Proposed change

A new React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + pnpm project (`housecenter-web`) built from scratch,
consuming all endpoints of the HouseCenter REST API via TanStack Query.

**UI Kit:** Untitled UI for React (commercial Tailwind-based component library).
Consistent, professional design without multiple competing libraries.

## Tech stack

| Concern | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Bundler | Vite 8 | Fast HMR, native ESM, no CRA bloat |
| Language | TypeScript 5.x strict | API contracts enforced at compile time |
| Package manager | pnpm | Faster installs, disk-efficient |
| UI | Untitled UI for React | One design system, Tailwind-based, no MUI/Semantic conflict |
| Routing | React Router v7 | File-based routing, loader pattern, nested layouts |
| Server state | TanStack Query v5 | Cache, background refetch, pagination, optimistic updates |
| Forms | React Hook Form + Zod | Schema-driven validation, mirrors API DTOs |
| HTTP client | Axios with interceptors | Auto-attach Bearer, auto-refresh on 401, typed responses |
| Auth | JWT in memory (access) + httpOnly cookie (refresh) | Secure token storage |
| Dark mode | Tailwind `dark:` classes | User preference from API `PATCH /users/me/theme` |

## What this replaces from legacy

| Legacy capability | Status in new app |
|---|---|
| Login (GraphQL) | Replaced with `POST /auth/login` |
| `GET /me` on boot | Replaced with `GET /auth/me` |
| Theme toggle (localStorage) | Replaced with `PATCH /users/me/theme` + Tailwind dark: |
| Clinic CRUD | Feature-complete, same surface |
| Patient list | Paginated (was all-at-once) |
| Patient profile (tabs) | Added Sessions tab, Consultations tab |
| Treatment CRUD | Same + status transitions |
| Work Routes | Actually built now (was missing) |
| Collaborators | Actually built now (was missing) |
| User management | Same + role assignment |
| Invitations | Actually built now (was missing) |
| Sessions | New — didn't exist in legacy |
| Consultations | New — didn't exist in legacy |
| Reports / dashboard | Real aggregated data (was static home) |
| Notifications | New — didn't exist in legacy |
| Attachments | New — didn't exist in legacy |
| Apollo / GraphQL | Removed entirely — REST + TanStack Query |
| MUI + Semantic UI | Removed — Untitled UI only |

---

## Out of scope

- Mobile app / React Native
- PDF/Excel export from reports
- Real-time WebSocket — polling for notifications only
- i18n — English only for now
- E2E tests (Playwright/Cypress) — unit + integration only for hooks/utils

---

## Why this is the right move

The API is complete. Building on house-mui-v1 would mean:
1. Gutting Apollo → REST migration across every hook
2. Adding TypeScript retroactively to ~100 JS files
3. Replacing MUI + Semantic with one system
4. Adding 7 missing pages from scratch anyway

Starting fresh with Vite + TS + Untitled UI takes the same effort as the migration,
produces cleaner code, and avoids carrying forward technical debt.
